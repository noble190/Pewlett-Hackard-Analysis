### Breakdown of upcoming retirees by position:

![PH counts by position](https://github.com/noble190/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/resources/CountRetireesByTitle.png)

* There are a total of 90,398 employees approaching retirement age at Pewlett Hackard
* The majority of the employees approaching retirement age hold senior engineering or staff positions
* Conversely, only 2 managers are approaching retirement age
* There are only 1,549 employees who can serve as mentors currently active at Pewlett Hackard

## Summary

1. The 'silver tsunami' will have a noticeable impact on Pewlett Hackard. As per the query results above, a total of 90,398 roles will need to be filled in the near future. Most significantly, 29,414 Senior Engineer and 28,254 Senior Staff will need to be replaced.

2. The data shows that only 1,549 qualified senior employees are available to mentor the next generation at Pewlett Hackard. This will likely not be enough to train effective replacements for the 90,398 retiring employees. We would recommend giving strong incentives for retiring employees to stay on as mentors to train the next generation.

For further analysis, it may be useful to break down the mentor data into counts by role, similar to the analysis that was performed for upcoming retirees. This would allow us to quickly identify roles that will be most acutely impacted by lack of mentors.

Additionally, it may be useful to run a query that returns a count of employees per active manager. The retirement counts showing only 2 retirement-pending managers out of 90,398 employees look suspect, and may suggest a lack of managers. If the managers are overloaded, they may not be able to manage their departments effectively.
